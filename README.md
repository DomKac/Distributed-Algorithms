# Distributed Algorithms

## Description

This repository contains tasks, implementations, and notes developed as part of the **Distributed Algorithms** course during the second semester of master’s studies in Computer Science. The course is based on theoretical foundations and practical models discussed at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

The main focus lies on designing and analyzing **algorithms in distributed systems**, where multiple computing units cooperate or compete while communicating through messages. The implementations may simulate processes and communication channels, reflecting real-world distributed scenarios.

## Topics Covered

- Models of distributed computation (synchronous and asynchronous systems)
- Message passing and communication assumptions
- Leader election algorithms
- Mutual exclusion and synchronization
- Consensus problem

## Technologies

Depending on the task, implementations may be written in:
- **Python**
- **C/C++**
- **Hadoop**
